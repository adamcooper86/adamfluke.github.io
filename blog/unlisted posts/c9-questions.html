    <h1>Getting the most from every question</h1>
    <h2>Specific, researched, unique</h2>

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>To get the answers you are looking for, it is important to be asking the right questions, the right way. Make sure your questions are unique, researched, and specific.</p>

      <h3>Unique</h3>
      <p>Consistently, the most likely reason a question gets ignored on a community site is because it was the same as a previously answered question. The expectation is that users search the site for a post that answers their question first. Failing to do so sends that message that the posts author values their time more than the rest of the community. It also clutters up a site and makes it difficult for people who are looking for answers since there are so many duplicate posts.</p>
      <h3>Researched</h3>
      <p>This goes along with unique, but also stands on its own. If you're having a problem, it has probably been answered somewhere on the internet, especially if it is more general (later). Everyone should be endevouring to solve their own problems first, that way only issues that a community is needed to be solved get raised. It makes the community more useable, scannable, and engaging. Further, how can anyone be sure their question is unique untill they have atleast researched it on that site first.</p>
      <h3>Specific</h3>
      <p>Tying in with researched, broad questions have almost certainly been answered through courses, how-to's, and language documentation. Asking a question like, "how do local variables differ from class variables?" wastes everyone's time since answers to that are easily accessibl from a google search. It is however possible, if your question is specific enough, that a preformatted answer just won't do, and a seldom seen interaction will help everyone learn. This does mean that all relevant code should be included in the post so that it is as specific as possible.</p>

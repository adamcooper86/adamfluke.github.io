    <h1>Stereo-type Threat</h1>
    <h2>When a loose/loose situation just gets worse.</h2>
    <p>Saturday May 16th, 2015</p>

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>Stereotype threat, or the perception of being judged socially based on the performance of an indentity stereotype, happens in most peoples lives several times a day, with varying concequences. During a nine-week intensive coding bootcamp, the number of oportunities for stereotype threat to come into play drastically increases, and their concequences felt more keenly.</p>

      <h3>On a personal level:</h3>
      <p>I have felt stereotype threat most keely in two of my professions, massage and teaching. As a massage therapist, there were a number of stereotypes that would crop up, that men are better at deep-tissue and implicitly worse at relaxation, that men who massage were gay and so straight men wouldn't want to be touched by them, etc. I felt these biases, and when I was put into the situation of a relaxation massage, I felt the pressure to be relaxing (never a good start) and felt judged at the end based on my gender and performance.</p>
      <p>However, I no longer massage very much. I am now a teacher, and hope to go back to teaching in the future, but I definately experience stereotype threat during my workday.<figure>

      During a lecture entitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk" alt="link to video of lecture">Identity and Stereotype Threat</a>, Claude M. Steele a Provost at Columbia University describes an experiement were female candidates were shown a slideshow of images before an interview where women were underrepresented 3-1 in pictures. The female participants picked up on this cue, and the parts of their brain that respond to feelings of danger/threat picked up. In the teaching profession, men are repressented 4-1, 8-1, 10-1. Depending on the school, gradelevels, etc, some grade-level teams may not have a single male, and it is entirely normal to be the only male in a meeting. This plays out in self percieved stereotypes like not being as able to use discipline techniques like "warm-strict", not being empathetic enough, or being able to work with some children because they don't like men.</p>
      <h3>Bootcamp from my perspective</h3>
      <p>Anticipating the environment at DevBootcamp, I want to guard against some of the isolating effects of stereotype threats. The environment is generally condusive to me, but I might feel like my whiteness comes into play if I am on a diverse team. Or my malenes, or my unathleticness. It is difficult to know before hand, but I think Prof. Steele's advice can work proactively, which would be to build relationships with people that are intentionally supportive.</p>
      <h3>Creating a healthy environment</h3>
      <p>I believe that every person, but especially every person who is doing a bootcamp to better themselves, want everyone else in their educational environment to have an equal sense of comfort and an equal chance of success. However, making that happen is a choice, it requires us to be proactive. In relation to stereotype threat, this means holding people accountable in ways that make it clear that it is their work being evalutated, and that you believe they can grow and can be successful. Further, you can be intentional in including everyone equally in a conversation or descision. This may mean direct democracy in decision making, or in pairs trying multiple approaches before evaluating them.</p>

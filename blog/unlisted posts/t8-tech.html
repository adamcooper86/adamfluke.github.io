    <h1>Active Record</h1>
    <h2>Using Ruby on Rails to manage the DB</h2>

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>I am no expert on interacting with a DB through SQL, but luckily, Rails does alot of that for me. It takes Ruby's syntactic sugar to the next level, and lets object models persist in the database.</p>

      <h3>The M in MVC</h3>
      <p>Active record is the Rails mechanism responsible for representing data and logic. Active Record helps create and use objects whose data persists to a database.</p??
      <h3>Active Record as ORM</h3>
      <p>Active record uses Object Relation Matching, meaning it takes properties of objects it is modeling, and matches it to tables, colomns, and records in a database. This means that we lowely developers write fewer queries, because Active record is able to use naming conventions to find the data.</p>
      <p>Active Record uses some naming conventions to find out how to map models and database tables. Rails will pluralize (Hat to hats, or CarTire to car_tires) your class names to find the respective database table. It also converts camel-case to snake_case to go from class names to table names.</p>

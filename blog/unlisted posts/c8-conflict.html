     <h3>Who is going to take responsiblity for a difficult situation?</h3>
     <p>Recently, in a work situation at the school I worked at, there was a situation where it became clear that the support for a difficult student needed to change. This set off a cascade of difficult conversations where most were trying to pass-off the problem to someone else. There was a lot of he-said-she-said, a lot of confusion, and leadership. This impacted me personally, because I was being told that the whole situation was being passed to me, by coworkers, without talking to me about it, or deciding as a group.</p>
     <h3>Fuzzy Communication</h3>
     <p>At its core, this situation was a problem of communication. I was getting messages through other people, who themselves weren't involved in making decisions. This lead to me feeling disrespected, as I wasn't consulted about changes that would have a drastic impact on my classroom. I felt like I was being forced to take on a responsiblity, because others didn't want to take responsiblity. This made me think that they didn't respect me as a professional, and angry that others decisions were having a negative impact on my work.</p>
     <h3>Resolution</h3>
     <p>After a particularly heated discussion with a coworker, I insisted on bringing in our boss to resolve the conflict. I think this was suboptimal, as the final schedule of responsiblities could have been arranged by everyone without her help. However, in a situation like that, were the communication had broken down before it began, bringing in an arbiter is necessary. If I were the initiating party, I'd like to think that I would initiate a conversation with the other party, and will endevour to make it part of team culture in the teams I'm on in the future to talk to stake-holders directly.</p>

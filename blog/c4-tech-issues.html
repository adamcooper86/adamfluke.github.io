      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>Women in the developement field report feelings of isolation, a hostile or offensive work environment, and perceptions of being passed over for promotion or choice assignments. In a sector of the economy that is predominately male, it is up to us to ensure all of our coworkers feel safe, respected, and recognized for their achievements.</p>

    <h3>Women in Development</h3>
    <p>Over the last few years there has been an increasing clamor over the treatment of women in the video game industry, sexual harassment, discrimination for promotion, working on overly sexualized representations of women, etc. Underneath that clamour has been a growing recognition that their experience isn’t an aberration in the tech industry, but the norm in many segments including development. This has meant that many women are leaving the field, or choosing not to enter it. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html#page=2" alt="Article on LA Time about women in technology.">Tracey Lien</a>, of The LA Times reported that of the women who enter the STEM fields, including developement, 50% will leave.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of attitudes and systems that are pushing women out of development work. Tracey Lien continued the report by saying that, “According to the Harvard study, [the reasons] include a "hostile" male culture, a sense of isolation and lack of a clear career path. An updated study in 2014 found the reasons hadn't significantly changed.” We’ll go into what makes a work environment hostile in a bit, hopefully in a positive way.</p>
    <p>Most of us won’t be in a position to influence the structural reasons that women feel pushed out of the development field, but it is important to discuss for context. One of the major factors pushing women out of development is being passed up for promotion or participation in major projects. There are a few theories for why this happens, but the baseline fact is that women in the technology fields are promoted at a substantially slower rate than their male counterparts.</p>
    <h3>What can “I” do about this?</h3>
    <p>(I being men, women, I can’t speak too much to your choices but you can find some resources linked at the bottom.)</p>
    <p>Professionalism - One of the major factors pushing our coworkers out of the field is a hostile work environment. It may not feel good to think that we have contributed to this, because we never “meant it to be that way”. But speaking as a man who has worked in two female dominated fields, massage and teaching, it really doesn’t matter. It is incumbent on everyone in a community to be proactively empathetic. Some guidelines to think about:<p>
    <p>Their not “one of the guys” and anything you would only say only to other guys just doesn’t belong in the workplace. There should be no expectation that  anyone you're working with sit silently and listen to comments about any race, ethnicity, religion, OR SEX/GENDER/SEXUALITY because you or any around you think it is funny. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility, and in a male majority workplace, that means it is our (read men) responsibility to shut down non-professional talk, privately or if necessary publicly.</p>
    <p>Keep romance out of the workplace. Even if you think she likes/wants/asked for your attentions, leaving gifts on desks, flirting, or romantic comments need to be done outside of work. Same goes for you my LGBTQ coworkers, because our goal is to encourage a professional workplace for everyone.
    <p>If you are in charge of setting up work social events, keep it respectful.</p>
    <p>Value work not the worker. This gets tricky, but to the best of your ability, evaluate the work. Take the time necessary to evaluate the product of your coworkers and when putting together teams, assigning team leaders, etc, guide the discussion towards those evaluations. A culture that values the product lends itself towards being inclusive.</p>
    <p>Reflect - All of us have associations in our own head that need to be examined. We expect women to be more communicative, more design focus, softer spoken, less confrontational, stupider, less willing to work, less able to lead. You may not be actively telling yourself these things, but can you honestly say that you would think twice, when there are a hundred things on your mind, deadlines, and meetings, before assigning a design focused project to the new hire because she’s probably good at that.</p>

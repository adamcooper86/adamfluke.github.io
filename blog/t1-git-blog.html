      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>Version control is a foundational skill and concept for web-developers, but learning about it doesn't need to feel ominous. Believe it or not, most of the concepts are very intuitive for most of us. Don't let the jargon of the locals keep you from embracing version control and learning conversational Git-speak.</p>

      <h2>Version Control</h2>
      <p>Version control is a difficult subject to define clearly, since it is a concept that includes multiple facets. So, lets just name them and then talk about them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Version control tracks the state of files as they change over time. A "commit" saves all of the changes to the file.
        </li>
        <li>Version control allows a developer to "branch" a copy of the folder to work on without changing the state of the master branch.</li>
        <li>Version control allows a team of developers to collaborate by pushing/pulling/merging branches with logic to resolve conficts(two changes to the same document).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first aspect is the easiest to understand from a layman's perspective. Most people are used to being able to save a word document, and if they make a huge mistake, being able to revert to previous versions to undo that mistake. Similarly, most computer users (I am hoping) use some sort of backup software (Timemachine for Mac users). All of the files in the computer are saved as a copy, and you can see them in relation to the time that they were backed up. Version control lets you do something very similar for a folder(and all the files in it) that repersents all of the code for a program.</p>
      <p>The second aspect gets a little bit more confusing, but version control includes the concept of "branching", which is git-speak for taking all of the code from the master copy and creating a editable sandbox copy that does not change the state of the master copy. To make this clear, you could create a branch for the folder that represents this blog, call it happy-code and replace all of the files with an image of a smiling emogi cat and it would not change this file at all. Assuming that the work I did on happy-code was actually benificial, like implementing a new feature, then the branch gets merged into the master and does change the the folder that gets published.</p>
      <p>Branching is also what allows multiple developers to work on the same project without constantly conflicting with eachothers work. The branch that developer A is working on doesn't affect the master branch, which means that the branch that developer B is working on is a clean copy that works. When developer A finishes her branch, developer A can check it before merging it with the master branch and vice-versa. </p>
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <p>Git is a command line version control program. Using a robust array of commands, a developer uses git to branch, add/commit changes, move between commits(forwad and backward) and perform all of the functions described above. It is version control for your local machine.</p>
      <h2>Github</h2>
      <p>Github, by contrast, is version control for the cloud (ish). Github is like dropbox, but for git files and the folders that they are storing. It provides a suit of tools for a team of developers to review/merge eachothers branches through pull requests, and visual tools. It is important to note that Github is not/did not produce git. Git came first, it was a powerful tool before github, but Github made it much easier for teams of developers to collaborate using git.</p>

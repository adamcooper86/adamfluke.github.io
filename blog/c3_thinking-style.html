    <h1>ASCRAR - ASsume CRAzy Reasons</h1>
    <h2>Thinking about how you're thinking is a trip.</h2>
    <p>April 26th, 2015</p>
    <aside>
      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>Delve deep into how I think about how I think. Its a trip, partway down memory lane and to the right of objectively rational. Hopefully the way I think will change and adapt to the demands place on me in the months to come.</p>

      <h3>Thinking Strategies</h3>
      <p>I am generally sceptical of pseudo-sciences (homeopathy, etc.) and personality studies are right on the border for me. Anything that reminds me of my first Myspace quiz (I got Superman as the super-hero that I am, on the third try), tips the scales even further against it. My natural inclination when presented with <a href=”http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html” alt=”Gregoric thinking quiz”>the quiz</a>, is to game the quiz to get a flattering alignment. Probably tells you more about who I am than the quiz results, but, hey, I am a game player. I love games, and the most powerful thing that you can do in any game is break it.</p>
      <p>All that aside, I suspended disbelief for a few minutes and tried to be as genuine and honest in my answers as possible. The hope being that doing so will give me some insight, as statistically insignif… sorry forgot I was suspending disbelief.</p>
      <p>The result was a nearly isosceles triangle with a right angle at 50 AR. The only thing that I don’t seem to be is Concrete Sequential. This makes me think that it might be most useful to define what I am not.</p>
      <blockquote>Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.</blockquote>
      <p>I would at least like to think that I am most of this, and I guess I am in parts since I am both AS and CR. The key difference seems to be in how things get paired up, since I am not always an ordered (read organized) person, and enjoy strategies that aren’t linear. So I guess, in the fabulous fortune teller tradition of post-rationalization, that the negative result is accurate.</p>
      <p>What does that tell me about how to support my learning? Well it atleast seems to imply that I don’t need to worry so much about making sure my learning environment is structured, or that the group has a clear agenda when talking.</p>
      <p>ASCRAR- The rest of the thinking styles I seem to be an equal mix of. I Have tride to figure out a method to figure out my predominate style, and there are 2 R’s and 2 A’s in my code of likely thinking styles, so AR seems to be good enough. Let’s dig into that style to see what we can find about what I should be looking to problem solve.</p>
      <ul>
      <h4>This learner likes:</h4>
        <li>to listen to others</li>
        <li>bringing harmony to group situations</li>
        <li>establishing healthy relationships with others</li>
        <li>focusing on the issues at hand</li>
      <h4>They learn best when:</h4>
         <li>in a personalized environment</li>
         <li>given broad or general guidelines</li>
         <li>able to maintain friendly relationships</li>
         <li>able to participate in group activities</li>
      <h4>What's hard for them?</h4>
         <li>Having to explain or justify feelings</li>
         <li>Competition</li>
         <li>Working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
         <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
         <li>Working with people who don’t seem friendly</li>
         <li>Concentrating on one thing at a time</li>
         <li>Giving exact details</li>
         <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So in when they learn best category, it suggests that I work in groups (good fit for DBC), and have a personalized learning environment. I think that some of that will be a really good fit for the DBC intensive time, because it is group focused, and there is a lot of room for advocacy and input into the learning. However, I am sure there are going to be lots of instances where I won’t be able to have a personalized learning environment, and that I will have to work with teams that are unharmonious.</p>
      <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>I take opperating under the growth mindset pretty much for granted at this point. In education, believing that students can and do actively shape their intellegence is fundemental to engineering change. Applying this to DevBootcamp seems natural, I am a student attempting to change my base intellegence to allow me to be effective at creating programs. I hope that I can take that core, unshakeable belief all the way through the next two months.</p>

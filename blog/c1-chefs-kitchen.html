  <h1>Working in the Kitchen</h1>
  <h2>The challenge of taking control of our education</h2>
  <p>Saturday April 11th, 2015<p>
  <aside>
  <h2>Summary:</h2>
  <p>Most of us are conditioned to consume education, to take in what the universe(ity?) ordains we should learn. The Devbootcamp experience has the potential to be so much more. It is designed to let the learners push the curriculum, to mold the outcomes, and expand the range of whats possible. It is also, then, our responsiblity to do so.</p>
  </aside>
  <section>
    <p>So often it is expedient, comfortable, expected of us to consume a product as is. We are allowed to have opinions, rate it, etc. but are rarely if ever given an option to change what we don't like or shift the direction of the outcome. The Devbootcamp experience can be like this. Given enough effort and focus, a person/ a cohort can "get through" the program and learn a lot and have a lot of skills.</p>
    <p>However, they would be leaving so much potential fallow. There is a hope, a desire on the part of the creators and mentors at Devbootcamp to have every cohort meet the same baseline, and then blow past them in unique and interesting ways. Learning as part of a community means creating as a community. It means living out the values that brought us few, different as we are, all to the same place at the same time.</p>
    <p>My sincerest hope is that everyone who is there day one, in San Francisco, is there %100, fully present of why they are there, embracing the potential for radical growth, unexpected change, and invested in their success. Above that, I hope that I am just as commited and present to their success and fulfillment as I am in mine.</p>

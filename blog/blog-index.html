    <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
    <p>A easy-going blog about my travels through the wed-developement landscape; the refreshing streams, the lively communities, and the abundunt resources of the digital age.<p>
    <h2><a href="c4-tech-issues.html">Developement Women</a></h2>
    <p>Women in the developement field report feelings of isolation, a hostile or offensive work environment, and perceptions of being passed over for promotion or choice assignments. In a sector of the economy that is predominately male, it is up to us to ensure all of our coworkers feel safe, respected, and recognized for their achievements.</p>
    <h2><a href="t4-enumerable-methods.html">Find your way around .Map</a></h2>
    <p>Lets take a look at the Array method .map and discover where it takes us. It is a good example of a method built on the .each method, and can drastically simplify code that is over-reliant on the .each method.</p>
    <h2><a href="t3-arrays-hashes.html">Matryoshka Nesting Hashes</a></h2>
    <p>Do store something you need something, like a box. Arrays and hashes are Ruby's version of boxes. At their core, they both store objects, Integers, Strings, etc. However, they do differ in important and subtle ways.</p>
    <h2><a href="c3-thinking-style.html">ASCRAR - ASsume CRAzy Reasons</a></h2>
    <p>Delve deep into how I think about how I think. Its a trip, partway down memory lane and to the right of objectively rational. Hopefully the way I think will change and adapt to the demands place on me in the months to come.</p>
    <h2><a href="t1-git-blog.html">Do you Git it?</a></h2>
    <p>Version control is a foundational skill and concept for web-developers, but learning about it doesn't need to feel ominous. Believe it or not, most of the concepts are very intuitive for most of us. Don't let the jargon of the locals keep you from embracing version control and learning conversational Git-speak.</p>
    <h2><a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">The posiblity-responsiblity theorum</a></h2>
    <p>Most of us are conditioned to consume education, to take in what the universe(ity?) ordains we should learn. The Devbootcamp experience has the potential to be so much more. It is designed to let the learners push the curriculum, to mold the outcomes, and expand the range of whats possible. It is also, then, our responsiblity to do so.</p>
    <h2><a href="t2-css-design.html">Relatively Fixed or Absolutely Confused?</a><h2>
    <p>Being able to place elements on a web page is one of the most important aspects of web-design, but which choosing positioning value to use can be frustrating. The CSS position property is an opaque and obscure concept because the values are intuitive in many ways. Exploring the position property, however, can give a developer some clarity.</p>

    <h2><a href="t1-git-blog.html">Do you Git it?</a></h2>
    <p>Version control is a foundational skill and concept for web-developers, but learning about it doesn't need to feel ominous. Believe it or not, most of the concepts are very intuitive for most of us. Don't let the jargon of the locals keep you from embracing version control and learning conversational Git-speak.</p>
    <h2><a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">The posiblity-responsiblity theorum</a></h2>
    <p>Most of us are conditioned to consume education, to take in what the universe(ity?) ordains we should learn. The Devbootcamp experience has the potential to be so much more. It is designed to let the learners push the curriculum, to mold the outcomes, and expand the range of whats possible. It is also, then, our responsiblity to do so.</p>

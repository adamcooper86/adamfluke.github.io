        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>I have loved working in pairs with other DBC students while learning Ruby, especially on complex challenges. However, some parts of the DBC experience may be turning me into to the darkside, "Noooo! Nooo! *Over acting anguish* NooOooOOoo!"</p>

        <h3>Pair and Share!</h3>
        <p>Working in pairs has been my absolute favorite thing about DBC so far. I have met many intellegent, motiveated and encouraging people in the past 3 weeks that I couldn't help but be excited about what we have set out to do. I really enjoy seeing how people come at problems from different angles, and the process that they go through. I have worked with pairs that like to plan everything out before writing the code, and pairs that much prefer to get in the code and just start making tests pass. I really believe that talking through solutions, and describing what methods or techniques do helps us activeate parts of the brain that would otherwise lie fallow. From a learning perspective, talking about these concepts helps many of us to learn the techniques better, see <a href="https://www1.iclicker.com/do-students-learn-by-talking-to-each-other/" alt="research article about learning">this study.</a> But, I also think that it helps activete the frontal conrtex during problem solving and makes us more effecient, see <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/nervous_system_disorders/anatomy_of_the_brain_85,P00773/" alt="article about brain anatomy">this article from John's Hopkins.</a></p>
        <h3>I may not like feedback though...</h3>
        <p>Feedback, on the other hand, is a much more difficult pill to swallow. Intellectually, I completely concede that it is good for a community and individuals to have honest and frequent feedback. It helps everyone grow and create honest assesments of where a person is right now. Paired with a growth mindset, feedback should feel empowering and I should feel grateful to the person giving it.</p>

        <p>However, even midly constructive feedback sucks! I could never be a Jedi because as soon as Obi Wan told me to feel the force for the 10th time I'd throw the helmet at him and yell, "Do you feel the force... of this helmet hitting your face?!?" I have been obsessed with every little bit of negative feedback, going over it a thousand times like a thumb on a worry stone. Whenever I feel like a session didn't go well, I avoid going to Feedbackinator to see the feedback because I don't have 6 hours of lost sleep to give. I'm working on it, and generally do much better from feedback given in person, so I am not worried about Phase 1-3. I just need to get there without turning to the darkside.</p>

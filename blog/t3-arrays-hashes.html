    <h2>Ruby's collection object classes, Arrays and Hashes</h2>

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>To store something you need something, like a box. Arrays and hashes are Ruby's version of boxes. At their core, they both store objects, Integers, Strings, etc. However, they do differ in important and subtle ways.</p>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>Arrays are the easiest data "box" to understand. Imagine an egg carton. An array that models an empty would be an array with twelve nil values. If you took coins and put them in the egg carton, you would know what was in each section, how many sections there were, even where in the egg carton their was a 1956 quarter. However, outside of an implied order (what order they were put in), there wouldn't be any meaning to where you placed that quarter. In an array, the index value in always its place in relation to the start of the box, it knows what is next to itself, etc.</p>
      <h3>Hashes</h3>
      <p>Hashes on the other hand don't have an order. It is difficult to imagine a hash, but if you imagine several cups with labels on them, you can get close. Each cup has a lable on it, say salt or cummin. Inside of the salt cup would only be salt, you could ask how much salt there was and if there was enough to make bread. However, you couldn't, and wouldn't ask where the salt was in relation to the cummin. The cummin is in its own bowl, and they don't have an order, their just all there on the table. The table is the hash, it is where all of the key (bowls) / value (spices) pairs are stored.</p>

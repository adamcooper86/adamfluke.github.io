      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>Values are the framework from which success is built. I hope that mine are strong enough to support my dreams. Bravery will be my focus for my time in DevBootcamp and the year to come.</p>

    <h3>Values:</h3>
    <p>It is very difficult to define a value. They are inherently abstract, ideals that create meaning as we make decisions. Every decision is either based on our constellation values, ideals for ourselves, or in violation of them. Guilt or consceince can be thought of as the discongruence between what we do, and our values.</p>
    <h3>In general, I try to live up to these values:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Activism:     Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class = "selection">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>Compassion:   Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class = "selection">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>Creativity:   Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <span class = "selection">3</span> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>Flow:         Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <span class = "selection">5</span> Agree</li>
        <li>Spirituality: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <span class = "selection">5</span> Agree</li>
        <li>Volunteering: Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <span class = "selection">3</span> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>adventure:    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <span class = "selection">3</span> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>achievement:  Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class = "selection">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>challenge:    Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class = "selection">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>recognition:  Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <span class = "selection">4</span> ----- 5 Agree</li>
        <li>bravery:      Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <span class = "selection">5</span> Agree</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Bravery:</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of this year I participated in a professional developement that had me pick a single value for this year. The idea being that resolutions can be broken, and often fall away, but a value can be picked up countless times to influence the whole year.</p>
      <p>I choose the word, "brave". So much is changing in my life, I am moving, changing professions, starting a family, and going to DevBootcamp. I need to be brave to face these changes. Bravery is at the core of setting off into the new and unknown, and my life is an ocean of uncertaintity.</p>

    <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
    <p>A easy-going blog about my travels through the wed-developement landscape; the refreshing streams, the lively communities, and the abundunt resources of the digital age.<p>
    <h2><a href="blog/t1-git-blog.html">Do you Git it?</a></h2>
    <p>Version control is a foundational skill and concept for web-developers, but learning about it doesn't need to feel ominous. Believe it or not, most of the concepts are very intuitive for most of us. Don't let the jargon of the locals keep you from embracing version control and learning conversational Git-speak.</p>
    <h2><a href="blog/c1-chefs-kitchen.html">The posiblity-responsiblity theorum</a></h2>
    <p>Most of us are conditioned to consume education, to take in what the universe(ity?) ordains we should learn. The Devbootcamp experience has the potential to be so much more. It is designed to let the learners push the curriculum, to mold the outcomes, and expand the range of whats possible. It is also, then, our responsiblity to do so.</p>
    <h2><a href="blog/t2-css-design.html">Relatively Fixed or Absolutely Confused?</a><h2>
    <p>Being able to place elements on a web page is one of the most important aspects of web-design, but which choosing positioning value to use can be frustrating. The CSS position property is an opaque and obscure concept because the values are intuitive in many ways. Exploring the position property, however, can give a developer some clarity.</p>

      <p>This website design features a responsive web layout that scales from mobile deveices to large widescreen displays. It is a more traditional design meant to highlight the content and be comfortable for the eye to read.</p>

      <p>During this project I worked collectively with team members to clone the Berkshire Hathaway homepage using current HTML5 standards. Primarily, this showed that I was able to communicate with my teammembers effectively, and alternate roles in partner-coding.</p>

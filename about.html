        <p>Bibhub was designed first with a focus on students, honoring our first value, <span class = "text-primary">Build a better tomorrow</span>. There are a lot of student frustrations around behavoir data, but they can be grouped into three general catagories; Opaqueness, Inconsistency, and Ineffectiveness.<p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Opaqueness - </h4>
            <p>Many students who struggle with behavoir, also struggle with understanding the behavoir data tracking that is often implemented as part of their BIP. Since it is often related to their rewards, this opaqueness can lead to more frustration and reduce buy-in. It can feel like the reward system is being done to them instead of earned by them. This feeling is sometimes expressed as being "just lucky" on a successful day, or "I'm always like this" on less successful days.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Inconsistency - </h4>
            <p>We all know how important consistency is to all students. Poorly managed behavoir data is <span class="text-warning">inherently inconsistent!</span> When data is incomplete, lost, misrecorded, or just late in getting reported it breaks the behavoir/feedback cycle. Worse, it does so in a stochastic manner. This errodes the trust, sometimes nominal to begin with, that a student has that the system is fair. If data only gets back to the Special Education Teacher on good days, or only on bad days, the system is out of balance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Ineffectiveness - </h4>
            <p>The hands-down most demoralizing experience for the student is when <span class = "text-warning">it doesn't work</span>. Biphub's foundation is simple logic, bad data + good intentions = bad decisions. Hope is a precious commodity for students who feel cronically unsuccessful. Being under a behavoir plan that they can't be successful at, or that doesn't target the correct antecedents or skill gaps reinforces the idea that they are the problem. Poorly managed behavoir data systems are inherently dangerous because they can give false positives, fail to show successes that are happening, or take to long to give the team the signal that the student can't be successful.</p>
